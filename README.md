Bachelor thesis on Random Localised Robust Weighted (RLRW) Conformal Prediction on Nonexchangeable Data \\

NOTE: Most methods will be translated from R to Python from https://github.com/rohanhore/RLCP

A large issue when creating confidence intervals relies on the assumption that the data in exchangeable, i.e. for any symmetric algorithm $$\mathcal{A}(\{(X_i, Y_i)\}_{i \in [n]}) = \mathcal{N}(\{(X_\{\sigma(i), Y_{\sigma(i)}})\}_{i\in [n]})$$
